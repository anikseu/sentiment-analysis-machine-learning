# Sentiment Analysis with Algorithms

## Introduction

This repository contains Python code for sentiment analysis algorithms, implemented and demonstrated using Jupyter Notebooks. The sentiment analysis is performed using Bag of Words approach, with four different algorithms: Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression. Additionally, a detailed research idea is provided in a PDF document for further exploration.

## Sentiment Analysis Algorithms

The sentiment analysis algorithms included in this repository use the Bag of Words approach. Each algorithm is implemented separately for clarity and ease of understanding:

1. **svm.ipynb:** Implementation of sentiment analysis using Support Vector Machines (SVM) with Bag of Words.

2. **naive_bayes_model.ipynb:** Implementation of sentiment analysis using Naive Bayes with Bag of Words.

3. **randomforest.ipynb:** Implementation of sentiment analysis using Random Forest with Bag of Words.

4. **logistic_regression_model.ipynb:** Implementation of sentiment analysis using Logistic Regression with Bag of Words.

## Jupyter Notebooks and Dependencies

To run the Jupyter Notebooks, you need to have Jupyter installed along with the necessary libraries. Follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sentiment-analysis-algorithms.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   This will install Jupyter Notebook, scikit-learn, pandas, and other necessary libraries.

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

   Navigate to the `notebooks` directory and open the desired notebook to explore and run the sentiment analysis algorithms.

252,"When we, the voters, should have been looking around for suitable candidates to vote for and punish the previous ones who have let us down, we are instead passing our days in suspense and worry, and enduring each night in fear of plainclothes policemen (or their impersonators) barging into our homes and making us âdisappearâ because a friend or a relative at some point joined an opposition procession somewhere. And due to the opposition, we are being forced to either close down our offices, businesses, shops, factories, and schools, or operate them at the risk of being attacked at any time. We demand in the strongest of terms that our political leaders, from both sides, desist from their present politics and end our living in this unnerving state.",negative,

But before these accomplishments can sink into our minds, we are being traumatised by the political unrest which both the government and the opposition are responsible for; the former significantly more as it has taken no initiative to settle pre-existing issues before the latter took to the streets with its movement and consequent violence. This overwhelming sense of not knowing whatâs next is sapping us of the energy and hope that is crucially necessary to push the country forward.",positive,

Exports earnings are dipping low, as are the value of taka and our foreign currency reserve.",negative,
255,Why are our leaders being irresponsible and turning a deaf ear to these dire predictions?,negative,
256,"Our prime minister has repeated ad nauseam her determination to hold a free and fair election. But do her and her partyâs recent actions show that such is their aim? Is calling the opposition a âterrorist organisationâ and its leaders all sorts of names, as well as using the most threatening language while referring to them, create an environment for a decent election?",negative,
257,"According to our report on November 8, family members, drivers, assistants, and elderly relatives of any concealed person that police are looking for are also being arrested. Such actions cannot take place unless there is a total disregard for the law. Forget the fundamental legal tenet that one is innocent until proven guilty; the present practice is to punish anybodyâchildren, spouses, elderly relatives, extended family members, friends, and paid assistantsâin order to force the person the police are seeking to come out of hiding. This is a travesty of justice of the highest order.",negative,
258,"According to BNP, 8,951 of its leaders and activists have been arrested across the country since October 28, 2023.

The figure is much higher when arrests made on the whole are considered.",positive,
259,"Then there is the question of how BNP leaders are treated once in jail. Since they are all arrested under specific chargesâunlawful assembly, deterring police duty, damage to property, blasting explosives, and vandalismâthey are treated like common criminals and not as political prisoners entitled to better treatment. Mirza Abbas, a very senior BNP leader and a former minister, claimed in court that he was forced to sleep on the floor of his cell along with all sorts of criminals.",negative,

However, as of November 7, there were 88,000 prisoners, making for twice the number that our prisons can hold. This sudden rise is mostly due to the imprisonment of BNP activists after their October 28 gathering. According to the rules, each prisoner is entitled to a six-feet-by-six-feet space as a basic right. Even this the jail authorities are currently unable to provide.",negative,
261,"The specific case of Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir, the secretary general of BNP (a very senior and highly respected politician), shows how laws are being used to punish politicians. He is 75 years old and suffers from many ailments, including cardiac issues. He was arrested on the morning of October 29 for the unlikely allegation of âattacking the residence of the chief justice.â He moved for bail on November 2, and the learned judge fixed the date of hearing for November 20. Two things need to be pointed out here. Firstly, is it believable that a man of his stature would attack the house of the chief justice? Wouldnât that have attracted the attention of the respected judge? Secondly, by fixing the hearing date 18 days later, it was ensured that Fakhrul would serve a jail term of 18 days even before a word can be uttered about his fundamental rights. This is as clear a lesson as any for all who may contemplate joining any of the opposition rallies in the future.",negative,
262,"Is it conceivable that we could have a free and fair election under these circumstances? With such government oppression and all-out efforts to destroy the biggest opposition party, what hope can there be of any election, let alone a free and fair one? Whatever distance already existed between the two political rivals, it has now been burdened further by a profound sense of anger, indignity, injustice, maltreatment and outright demonisation, destroying any chanceâif there ever was any in the first placeâof political rapprochement.",negative,
263,"In the name of holding free and fair elections, the government has unleashed a policy of totally crushing BNP into smithereens. It has also initiated the discredited policy of creating factions and luring away some disgruntled elements to form a rival group, which will presumably toe the governmentâs line.",negative,
264,"So, what is going on is election engineering, not preparation for a free and fair election. A lot of money is at play, and the police and legal system are being used. The net result is that, instead of the public selecting our leaders through the exercise of their franchise, a set of preselected leaders will be forced upon us via all sorts of chicanery and manipulation. This would have been called a charade in any other country. But for us, this is how we fulfil our pledge to âuphold democracy at any cost.â",neutral,

Meanwhile, ready-made garment (RMG) workers are on the streets demanding fair wages.",negative,
513,"Besides, close to the end of the governmentâs current tenure, a whole bunch of civil servants and police officials got promoted. One should note that these two groups are widely considered to be responsible for helping AL win earlier elections, and are set to play a significant role in the upcoming polls too.",neutral,
514,"It is in this context that Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is inaugurating infrastructure projects around the country, seeking votes for her party. A string of milestone undertakings is providing ample opportunities for an unofficial election campaign. Whatâs more, no one will deny that the country has seen massive development work in the last 15 years. However, the other narrative revolves around rampant corruption, blatant nepotism and substantial money laundering.",,
515,"While the prime minister is unofficially on her campaign trail, the opposition camp is on the run. One can say that the opposition is responsible for such a turn of events, but no one can really be sure of who it was that threw the first proverbial punch.",,
516,"Violence in Bangladesh politics is nothing new and not one-sided. When the Awami League was in opposition, it was also engaged in fierce violence. The major political partiesâAwami League and BNPâhave always been in clashes over the last three decades for their own political interests. So, blaming BNP alone for violence and clashes just before the national election is only an attempt to keep it away from the electoral battle.",,
517,"This time, however, the circumstances are more complex. The economic situation is quite precarious, the international community is keeping an eye on elections, and the peopleâs frustration appears to have peaked from being deprived of their democratic right to vote. Peopleâs votes did not really seem to matter in the last two elections, as the results were obvious even before the first ballot was cast on election day. So, the ruling party wants to show at least a competitive election, and thatâs why, as per media reports, the government wants some BNP leaders in the election but not the BNP itself. Information Minister Hasan Mahmud told journalists that many were queuing up to join Trinamool BNP, a party founded by former BNP leader Barrister Nazmul Huda in 2015, and that another party would be formed by former commerce minister and BNP leader Hafiz Uddin Ahmad. But Hafiz did not confirm the claim. He said he hoped to stay in the party till the end of his political career.",,
518,"More than BNPâs house of cards, these machinations and remarks reflect poorly on Bangladeshâs oldest political party, which is now harbouring questionable ethicsâso much so that it is now attempting to break up another political party, one that it claims was born in the cantonment and run by arsonists.",,
519,"So, when this is the situation with the elections only two months away, one can easily imagine what is going to happen if this continues. And worryingly, we donât see any chance of the scene changing. If anything, it will very likely become more complicated once the election schedule is announced. The opposition parties will come up with more programmes, and the government will be harsher on the opposition to maintain law and order. And consequently, a fearful situation will arise in which voters will not be interested in the festivities surrounding the election, nor will they be interested in casting their votes.",,
520,"We all know that regional and global geopolitics is carrying a lot of weight in our national election right now. The international community has seldom shown so much interest in our state of affairs before. The US has made its position clear, saying that it wants to see a free and fair election, and for that, it imposed visa restrictions. China has said it wants Bangladeshâs elections to be held as per the constitution. India said Bangladeshâs election is an internal matter, and it is for the people of Bangladesh to decide their future. India has said as a close friend and partner of Bangladesh, it respects the democratic process and will continue to support the countryâs vision of a stable, peaceful and progressive nation.",,
521,"All this can be interpreted in two ways. It can be a matter of great pride that we have become a centre of attention of the big regional and global powers. The other perspective, however, is that although the national election is an internal issue, it is unfortunate that we have not yet been able to devise a sustainable system to hold a free, fair and participatory election through which power can be transferred smoothly.",,
522,"Winter is knocking on the door, and the morning fog is making its yearly return. The same way, the election is closing in and the uncertainty around it is thickening.",,
523,"Rising prices of daily essentials, the freefalling value of taka against the dollar, a plummeting foreign exchange reserve, unrest in the RMG sector, and the international community watching quite intentlyâall these might make it too costly to hold an election like the ones in 2014 or 2018. There are simply too many factors that are unfavourable for the incumbents. Even a slight change in the wrong direction may bring bad news for the authorities.",,
